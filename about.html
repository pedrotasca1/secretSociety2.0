    <p class="about-description">
      Secret Society is a scroll-based storytelling web application that explores the underground world of graffiti culture. Built as part of my Creative Coding assessment, this project delves into the tools, techniques, and unspoken rules that define graffiti as both an art form and a social statement.
    </p>
    
    <p class="about-description">
      The narrative unfolds through dynamic animations and layered visuals powered by GSAP, creating an immersive user experience. The site integrates horizontal and vertical scrolling effects, animated transitions, and stylised collage elements to convey the rebellious, expressive spirit of street art.
    </p>

    <p class="about-description">
      Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed and developed this experience from scratch. The layout and interactions are inspired by the visual chaos of urban environments while remaining structured and readable. All assets and designs were created or curated to support the overall theme.
    </p>

    <p class="about-description">
      This project challenged me to think critically about user interaction, visual rhythm, and technical performance â€” and allowed me to combine my interests in storytelling, subculture, and web animation into one cohesive piece.
    </p>

      I would like to extend my gratitude to Koundinya Dhulipalla for providing invaluable insights and sharing thoughtful content that enriched my understanding and approach to this project.
