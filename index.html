                        Well, that’s really difficult to explain because graffiti means many different things to all kinds of people.<br>
                        While your 80 year-old neighbour might associate graffiti as vandalism, others can see it as an art form.<br>
                        Generally speaking, graffiti is used to describe everything from tags and scratched names on the underground to graffiti-influenced artwork on canvas.<br>

                    Alright, let’s talk tools—the bread and butter of graffiti art. Without the right gear, you’re just someone with a wall and a dream. This section is all about getting you familiar with the essentials.

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    In the world of graffiti, markers are often the tool of choice for tagging. They’re quick—just a few strokes, and they’re done—so you’re in and out before anyone can spot you.<br>
                    Some graffiti artists modify their markers, either by adding ink or changing the tips to create different effects. The ink is usually bold and durable, meaning it can stand up to the elements and stay visible for longer periods, even in rough urban environments.<br>
                    Markers allow artists to be sneaky, efficient, and still make an impact, all while avoiding the mess and risk of using spray paint in public spaces. So for illegal graffiti, markers are the perfect tool to keep things fast, stealthy, and effective.

                <p class="section-paragraph">  
                    Spray cans are the ultimate weapon of choice. They’re bold, versatile, and let you create massive, eye-catching pieces with ease. From quick throw-ups to elaborate murals, spray cans give artists the freedom to dream big and go wild.<br>  
                    <br>
                    While spray cans are louder and riskier to use in public compared to markers, they’re unmatched when it comes to making a statement. They let you cover large surfaces quickly and bring life to a wall in ways no other tool can.

                    Fire extinguishers may seem like an unconventional choice for graffiti, but they’ve become a surprising tool for creating massive tags. <br>
                    By modifying an old fire extinguisher and filling it with paint, graffiti artists can spray enormous letters and designs that dominate entire walls.

                "Graffiti has its own unspoken rules and a hierarchy that defines the art form’s respect and credibility. At the base are tags—simple, quick signatures that establish presence. Next come throw-ups or “throwies,” bubble-letter designs often created with spray paint. These are more time-consuming but still relatively quick to produce.
                Then there are pieces, or “masterpieces,” which are large, detailed artworks that showcase skill, creativity, and commitment. True respect in the graffiti world comes from these intricate works, which require not only talent but also the courage to spend hours on a wall. Understanding the hierarchy helps newcomers respect the culture and earn their place in the scene."
